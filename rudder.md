# Current Goal: Cycle through background images

*Have a default image as a background, and be able to scrub forward and backward through a set list*

---

## Project Specific

`Initial image should be Syaksa. Forward should move through each of the track images, starting with Portal, then Penrose Engine, TFF, etc.`

---

# Notes

- When clicking forward or back buttons, they should load a different img tag
